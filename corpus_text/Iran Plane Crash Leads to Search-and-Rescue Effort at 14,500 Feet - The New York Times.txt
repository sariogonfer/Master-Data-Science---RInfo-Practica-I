TEHRAN — Search-and-rescue workers continued to scour a mountainous region of Iran on Monday for a plane that crashed a day earlier, most likely killing all 66 people on board.Because of bad weather conditions, the rescue teams have been unable to fly over the crash site in helicopters. Instead, they have climbed Mount Dena, which has an elevation of about 14,500 feet. As of Monday afternoon, the teams had not found any debris from the plane, which was operated by Iran Aseman Airlines.Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi, the minister of roads and urban development, said on Monday said that there was “total ambiguity” surrounding the crashing of the plane, an ATR-72 twin-engine turboprop used for short regional flights, which was en route to the southwestern city of Yasuj from Tehran on Sunday morning.Mr. Akhoundi told state television that 11 groups of experts were investigating flight details, weather conditions near the destination and radar data from air-traffic control to find out what might have caused the crash.TURKMENISTANCaspianSeaAFGHAN.TehranTabas   IRANMT.

Mohammad Taghi Tabatabai, a spokesman for Iran Aseman Airlines, first told state television that everyone aboard the aircraft had been killed. But the airline later issued a statement saying it could not reach the crash site and could not “accurately and definitely confirm” any deaths.AdvertisementIran has been struck by several accidents and natural disasters recently, and lawmakers have sought the resignation of Mr. Akhoundi and the minister for labor and social welfare, Ali Rabiei, because of their “inability” to address the challenges. Gholamreza Tajgardoun, who leads the Budget Consolidation Committee in Parliament, told the semiofficial news agency ISNA on Monday that lawmakers would seek to impeach the two ministers if they did not resign.AdvertisementThe plane was carrying 60 passengers and six crew members, according to state media. News reports said it disappeared from radar screens 50 minutes after taking off from Mehrabad International Airport, in western Tehran, which mainly serves domestic flights but has some international routes.Under decades of international sanctions, Iran’s commercial passenger aircraft fleet has aged, and it has regularly suffered accidents in recent years. The sanctions prevented the oil-rich country from updating its fleet, forcing it to use substandard Russian planes and to patch up older models far past their normal years of service, using spare parts bought on the black market.The ATR-72 involved in the crash on Sunday was a French-Italian aircraft introduced in the late 1980s. The Aseman fleet was delivered from 1993 to 2009.Follow Thomas Erdbrink on Twitter: @ThomasErdbrink.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
