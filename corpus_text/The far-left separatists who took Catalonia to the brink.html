					Tobias Buck in BarcelonaAnna Gabriel lives in a flatshare in a modest building tucked away in the bohemian Barcelona neighbourhood of Grácia. The first thing you see as you enter is a poster of Hugo Chávez, the late anti-capitalist leader of Venezuela, and a table stacked with political leaflets. The living room is small and spartan, devoid of books and personal objects.The humble surroundings are a world away from the sumptuous medieval palaces that house the Catalan president and his ministers. But there are many, not least inside the Spanish government, who believe that the rhythm and pace of Catalonia’s escalating conflict with Madrid are dictated not by the official Catalan leadership but by Ms Gabriel and her far-left separatist party. The Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) holds just 10 of 135 seats in Catalan’s regional parliament, but without them President Carles Puigdemont has no majority to continue his separatist course. That has given the CUP and Ms Gabriel, the spokeswoman of the party’s parliamentary group, sweeping power to shape the political process. More often than not, they have used it to press for a hardline, confrontational stance that could culminate in a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain as early as next week. Ms Gabriel argues that there is simply “no alternative” to such a declaration, especially after the events surrounding Sunday’s independence referendum. The vote, which had been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court, was marred by violence after Spanish police tried to interrupt the voting process and confiscate ballot boxes. Madrid argues that its officers were defending the constitutional order against a de facto insurrection, but Ms Gabriel insists the intervention was a “savage and brutal attack against an entire people”.“Many people who were not in favour of independence now say that they no longer want to form part of a Spanish state that confronts political problems like this. In political terms, people are saying: is this what the Spanish state has to offer?”, she says. Spain, Ms Gabriel argues, is not only a state with “fascist roots” but also one that cannot acknowledge its own failure: “If you need so much brute force to defend the unity of the state, isn’t it evident that this unity does not exist?”Catalonia’s far-left Popular Unity Candidacy does not have formal leaders. But it does have a face, and it is that of Ms Gabriel, the spokeswoman for the party’s group in the Catalan parliament. She hails from a leftwing family of miners in Sallent, north of Barcelona, and trained both as a teacher and a lawyer. Ms Gabriel belongs to the radical wing of what is already, by European standards, a radical party. The CUP describes itself as a “clearly socialist organisation with the objective of replacing the capitalist socio-economic model with a new model that is centred on the human collective and that respects the environment”. It opposes Catalan membership of Nato and of the EU. Ms Gabriel is a veteran activist who was part of an anti-fascist group in her youth before setting up a local CUP chapter in her hometown. Her greatest fear, she once told a Spanish interviewer, is that the “havoc created by the capitalist system will be irreversible”.The fact that the CUP’s pronouncements are taken seriously in both Madrid and Barcelona highlights a broader shift inside the independence camp. In the four decades since Spain returned to democracy, the cause of secession has mostly been the preserve of radicals and outsiders, a minority that rarely exceeded 15 per cent of the population. That changed a decade ago, as mainstream politicians and voters started adopting the call for independence. Beginning with Artur Mas, Catalan president until 2016, support for secession and a referendum on secession became the official policy of the Catalan government.Now, however, the focus is on mobilisation not negotiation — and the power is shifting back to the streets, to pro-independence grassroots movements such as the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, and to the CUP, which sees itself more as a collective of local organisations than a traditional party. “This is a process without a steering wheel and without brakes,” says Oriol Bartomeus, a political scientist at the Autonomous University in Barcelona. “The Republican Left and PdeCat have totally lost control,” he says, referring to the two pro-independence parties who jointly form the Catalan government. “And that loss of control means that the groups that are imposing their agenda are organisations like the ANC and Omnium and the CUP. They are the ones ensuring that the process continues.”As president of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), Mr Sánchez is a pivotal figure in the independence process. Founded in 2012, the ANC has become the principal grassroots movement pushing for secession. It has branches in every town and village of the region, and can count on tens of thousands of highly motivated volunteers. Mr Sánchez has been a prominent leader of the Catalan nationalist movement for decades. In the early 1980s, he was a senior member of La Crida a la Solidaritat, a Catalan group famous for organising a mass rally in Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium under the motto “We are a nation” as early as June 1981. Mr Sánchez is now under investigation for sedition for his role in helping to organise Sunday’s independence referendum.The claim that CUP leaders such as Ms Gabriel are running the show is made not least by Madrid. Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, referred to the group’s influence in a recent speech, warning that Catalan policy was being “determined” by “radicals and extremists”. Ms Gabriel and other CUP leaders dismiss that assertion. According to David Fernández, another prominent party figure, the CUP sees its role above all as “holding up a mirror” to the Catalan leadership. That leadership, however, knows better than most the influence that the CUP can command: Mr Puigdemont became president in January 2016 only because the group’s deputies refused to back his predecessor for another term in office.Despite its radical roots and positions (which include taking an independent Catalonia out of Nato and the EU), the CUP has so far made common cause with the more centrist, business-friendly elements of the independence movement. The president of Omnium Cultural is a businessman from Sabadell, and veteran activist in matters of Catalan culture and politics. He was one of the driving forces behind the creation of FemCat, a pro-independence business lobby. Founded in 1961 during the years of Franco dictatorship, Omnium was initially focused on promoting and preserving Catalan language and culture at a time of intense repression. Over the years, it became increasingly political, eventually joining the call for an independent Catalan state. Along with the ANC, Omnium figures as the principal organiser of the mass independence rallies held every year on September 11, Catalan national day. Mr Cuixart is under investigation by the Spanish courts for sedition.But Ms Gabriel is frank about her party’s ultimate goals. “For us independence is not an end in itself. It is an instrument to change the rules of the game and the material conditions of life of the majority of the people.”She acknowledges that even an independent Catalan republic is unlikely to back the CUP’s radical brand of socialism. But she points to recent examples of progressive Catalan legislation on issues such as police tactics and energy poverty as signs that a new state could tilt markedly to the left.And if Spain answers a unilateral declaration with arrests of senior leaders and a takeover of the regional government? “Of course there is fear. It would be frivolous to say that we are not afraid that the tanks will return,” says Ms Gabriel. “But what should we do? Nothing? Stay at home, paralysed?”Catalonia’s parliament votes for reforms to the region’s autonomy statutes, which grant the regional government more power and financial autonomy and recognise Catalonia as a nation Spain’s parliament approves a different version of the reforms, less to the liking of pro-independence Catalans.
