The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme.Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.  There are growing calls for gun control reform after 17 people died in a Florida school shooting.
